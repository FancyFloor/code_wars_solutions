Create a function that takes in the sum and age difference of two people, calculates their individual ages, and returns a pair of values (oldest age first) if those exist or null/None if:

sum < 0
difference < 0
Either of the calculated ages come out to be negative

function getAges(sum, difference){
  
  let arr = [];  
x = (sum + difference) / 2
y = sum - x
arr.push(x, y);
if (sum < 0 || difference <0 || x < 0 || y < 0) {
  return null
} else return arr
  
}
